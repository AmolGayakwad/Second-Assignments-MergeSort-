Implimentation of MergeSort Algorithm:

Introduction:
In this assignment, We learn how to use merge sort with a practical example in simple terms. Merge sort is like organizing a your stuff neatly to find it easily.

Assignment:
Imagine we have a list of employee details like their ID, name, salary, and performance rating. We want to sort based on their salary using merge sort.

Lets understand how Merge Sort Function works:

First, we divide the array into smaller sub-array until each sub-array has only one element. This makes sorting easier.
Then, we compare sub-array and put them in order based on their salary. We keep doing this until all array are sorted.

Merging arrays:
To merge the sorted arrays, we compare the salary of employees and arrange them in order. This creates a new sorted array.

Recursive Sorting:
We repeat this process for each sub-array until the whole array is sorted. This is like sorting sub-arrays first, then combining them until the entire array is organized.

Final Result:
After sorting all the array using merge sort, we get sorted list of employees by order of their salary.

Learning from Assignments:

1. learning function in javascript.
2. Understanding logics behind the functions.
3. learning about sorting technique especially MergeSort Algorithm.
4. Conditions in loops.
